# Delivery App — Documentation

Design and architecture documentation for the construction-site delivery MVP.

## Start here

**[architecture/00-overview.md](architecture/00-overview.md)** — the entry point. Locked technical decisions, MVP in/out scope, the full architecture with diagrams, the data model, the phased roadmap, and open blockers.

## Other directories

- **[adr/README.md](adr/README.md)** — Architecture Decision Records. One per locked decision, with the alternatives we rejected and why.
- **[runbooks/README.md](runbooks/README.md)** — Operational guides per persona plus the dry-run checklist. These describe the **new** system; the PDFs in `External Notes/` describe the retired low-tech process.

## Conventions

- Diagrams are [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) in fenced code blocks so they render on GitHub and in most editors, and diff cleanly in review.
- Anything not built in the MVP is listed in [Deferred work](architecture/12-deferred-and-extension-points.md) alongside the specific hook that makes it a small addition later.
