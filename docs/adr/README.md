# Architecture Decision Records

One record per significant technical decision: what we chose, what we rejected, and what it costs us.

Format follows [Michael Nygard's ADR template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) — context, decision, consequences, alternatives.

## Adding a record

1. Copy the structure of an existing ADR.
2. Number it sequentially — numbers are never reused.
3. **Always include the alternatives you rejected and why.** A decision without its alternatives is a statement, not a record, and the next person will re-litigate it.
4. State the negative consequences honestly. An ADR with no downsides is a sales document.
5. If a decision changes, do not edit the record — add a new ADR that supersedes it, and mark the old one `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`.
