# 12 — Deferred Work & Extension Points

Everything deliberately not built in the MVP, and the specific hook that makes each one a small addition rather than a rewrite.

> **Status:** Reference. Consult before proposing new scope.

## Why this document exists

"This is out of scope" is not useful on its own. What makes a deferral safe is knowing **what was left in place** so the feature can be added without disturbing what already works.

Each entry below states the hook that already exists. If an item has no hook, that is a design gap worth fixing now rather than later.

---

## Order lifecycle

### Item substitution

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Driver or dispatcher marks an item out of stock and records a substitute or removes it, recalculating the total |
| **Why deferred** | Your dry-run notes flag it as an open question; the policy (who may substitute, whether the customer pre-approves) is undecided |
| **Hook** | `order_items.item_status` enum already contains `unavailable` and `substituted`; `order_items.substituted_by_item_id` and `note` columns exist |
| **To build** | UI to set item status and link a substitute; a recalculation path; a customer notification |
| **Size** | Small — schema is done. The work is UI plus a decision about authorisation |

### Cancellation

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Cancel an order at any pre-purchase status, with a reason and a terminal state |
| **Why deferred** | Listed as an open question in the source material; no policy for refunds or fees on cancellation |
| **Hook** | `cancelled` is in the `order_status` enum **and** in the transition map with no UI; `orders.cancellation_reason` column exists |
| **To build** | A cancel action on the dispatcher console; offer withdrawal; customer notification |
| **Size** | Small — the state machine already accepts it |

### Automated customer status fan-out

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Email or SMS the customer automatically on each status change instead of the dispatcher doing it by hand |
| **Why deferred** | Listed as vNext in your workflow doc; the MVP keeps the dispatcher in control while the process is being validated |
| **Hook** | `order_status_events` is an append-only log of every transition — this is the event source. `notifications` already has a `dedupe_key` |
| **To build** | An Inngest fan-out subscribed to status events, plus templates |
| **Size** | Small-to-medium. **This is the highest-value post-MVP addition** — it is the main remaining manual step |

### Multi-store orders

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | One order spanning Lowe's and Home Depot |
| **Why deferred** | Explicitly a vNext idea; it complicates dispatch (two pickups), pricing (two mileage legs), and evidence (two receipts) |
| **Hook** | `orders.retailer` is a single value today; `retailer_stores` is already a separate table |
| **To build** | An `order_pickups` child table, per-pickup status, and a rework of the dispatch and evidence flows |
| **Size** | Large — a genuine data model change. Deferring is correct |

## Intake

### In-app cart building (product catalog)

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Customers search and build a cart inside our app instead of at the retailer |
| **Why deferred** | Requires a real product catalog and pricing feed — a separate product, not a feature |
| **Hook** | The parser's output schema (`CartSchema`) is the same shape any catalog would produce, so a catalog would feed the identical order-creation path |
| **To build** | Catalog ingestion, search, cart UI, and a pricing/availability source |
| **Size** | Very large |

### Parts database / concierge procurement

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | A searchable parts database so dispatchers can recommend alternatives when a part doesn't exist |
| **Why deferred** | Your MVP doc asks "Is it an API? Is it static?" — unanswered. Depends on the catalog above |
| **Hook** | Depends on the catalog; `order_items.model_number` gives a natural join key once it exists |
| **To build** | Catalog plus a recommendation UI |
| **Size** | Large |

### Smart iFrame

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Embed the retailer's cart in our UI so the customer can skip the email round-trip |
| **Why deferred** | Your notes flag it as possibly against terms of service, and "we don't know how plausible this is yet" |
| **Hook** | None — and none is warranted until the ToS question is answered |
| **To build** | Unknown; blocked on a legal/product answer |
| **Size** | Unknown. **Do not start without a ToS review** |

### Chat experience

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | In-app messaging between customer, dispatcher, and driver |
| **Why deferred** | Listed as an option, not a requirement; email plus the portal covers the MVP loop |
| **Hook** | `orders` is the natural thread container; `order_status_events` already models a chronological per-order stream |
| **To build** | A `messages` table, realtime subscription, and notifications |
| **Size** | Medium |

---

## Data enrichment

### Product enrichment API

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Pull dimensions, weight, and product URLs to auto-classify job size |
| **Why deferred** | Costs a vendor (~$66+/mo for Home Depot alone) and the email already carries what the MVP needs |
| **Hook** | `order_items` has room for additional columns; `quote_breakdown` is jsonb |
| **To build** | A vendor integration keyed on `model_number`, plus caching |
| **Size** | Small-to-medium |

### Aisle / Bay location data

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Tell the driver exactly where in the store each item is |
| **Why deferred** | The email has the columns but **they were empty in the sample**, so we cannot confirm Home Depot populates them. Populating them otherwise requires store-scoped scraping |
| **Hook** | `order_items.aisle` and `order_items.bay` columns exist and are already parsed |
| **To build** | Nothing if the email ever populates them — the parser would pick them up. Otherwise, enrichment |
| **Size** | Zero to large, depending on the answer. **Worth re-checking the email after a few real orders** |

### Live price and stock re-verification

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Confirm price and availability before dispatching a driver |
| **Why deferred** | The shared cart page returned **HTTP 403** to a plain fetch. Doing this needs residential proxies and a browser farm |
| **Hook** | `order_items` can hold a verified price alongside the email price |
| **To build** | Bot-bypass infrastructure and ongoing maintenance |
| **Size** | Large and permanent — a standing maintenance cost, not a one-time build |

---

## Money

### Fee rule engine

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Automatic sizing fee and mileage calculation from size class and distance |
| **Why deferred** | Your docs say "we need to sort out the fee structure" — the model itself is unsettled, so automating it now would encode a guess |
| **Hook** | `orders.quote_breakdown` is jsonb; `sizing_fee_cents` and `mileage_fee_cents` are already separate columns; `company_sites.lat/lng` and `retailer_stores.lat/lng` exist for distance |
| **To build** | A `fee_rules` config table, a geocoding call, and a calculator |
| **Size** | Medium. **The schema was designed for exactly this** — adding it will not reshape `orders` |

### Refunds

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Full or partial refunds |
| **Why deferred** | No refund policy yet; unlikely to be needed during a supervised dry run |
| **Hook** | `refunded` is already in the `payment_status` enum |
| **To build** | A Stripe refund call and a dispatcher action |
| **Size** | Small |

### Driver payouts

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Pay drivers through the platform |
| **Why deferred** | Stripe Connect brings driver KYC, tax reporting, and 1099 obligations — a compliance project, not a feature |
| **Hook** | `job_offers` records who did what, so payout amounts are already derivable |
| **To build** | Stripe Connect onboarding, transfer logic, and reconciliation |
| **Size** | Large. **Requires a decision about driver classification first** |

### Subscription / prepaid bucket billing

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | The "prepay bucket per month" idea from your workflow doc |
| **Why deferred** | Pricing model is undecided |
| **Hook** | `companies` is the natural billing entity |
| **To build** | A billing model and Stripe subscription integration |
| **Size** | Medium |

---

## Communication

### Customer SMS

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Text updates to customers, not just drivers |
| **Why deferred** | Customers are email-native and started the interaction by email; A2P registration is already needed for drivers, so the marginal cost is low but not zero |
| **Hook** | `notifications.channel` already supports `sms`; Twilio is already integrated |
| **To build** | A phone field on the checkout flow and a template |
| **Size** | Small |

### Slack integration

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Post order events to a Slack channel |
| **Why deferred** | You chose a clean break from the Slack + Sheets process — the app is the system of record. Slack as a *notification* is different from Slack as a *workflow*, but it is not needed for the MVP |
| **Hook** | `order_status_events` is the event source, same as the status fan-out |
| **To build** | A webhook post on status events |
| **Size** | Small — but only if it stays a notification, never a workflow |

---

## Platform

### Native mobile apps

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Real iOS/Android apps, especially for drivers |
| **Why deferred** | Your workflow doc lists phone apps for both company and driver as vNext. The driver app is a mobile-first PWA, which covers the MVP need at a fraction of the cost |
| **Hook** | The driver UI is already mobile-first and API-shaped, so a native client would consume the same endpoints |
| **To build** | Two apps, two release pipelines, two review processes |
| **Size** | Very large |

### Multiple portal users per company

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | More than one login per construction company |
| **Why deferred** | You chose one login per company for the MVP |
| **Hook** | **`profiles` already supports many rows per `company_id`.** The data model does not change at all |
| **To build** | A user-management UI in the dispatcher console |
| **Size** | Small — deliberately designed as a UI-only change |

### Automated re-broadcast on offer expiry

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Re-offer a job automatically when nobody accepts |
| **Why deferred** | An unfilled order is a signal a human should see, especially early on |
| **Hook** | The expiry workflow already runs; it currently notifies instead of re-offering |
| **To build** | Widen the pool and re-issue offers in the existing workflow |
| **Size** | Small |

## Traceability: source material to disposition

Every intake option and vNext idea from the source PDFs, and where it landed.

| Source item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Email the cart with alias | **MVP** — [05-email-intake](05-email-intake.md) |
| Per-user alias (`stephen_orders@…`) | **MVP, modified** — alias is per *company*, not per person |
| Parser (could be done by a person) | **MVP** — [06-cart-parsing](06-cart-parsing.md); the human path survives as the review queue |
| Attach order to the appropriate user | **MVP** — alias-based attribution |
| Temp email from website | **Rejected** — a per-company alias is simpler and stable |
| Notification the order has been parsed | **MVP** — `order_received_ack` |
| Standard checkout experience | **MVP** — post-intake portal checkout |
| Verify order items / total cost | **MVP** — checkout wizard |
| Delivery address / fee / instructions | **MVP** — checkout wizard |
| Payment (might direct to external site) | **MVP** — Stripe Payment Links |
| Parts database (concierge procurement) | Deferred |
| Smart iFrame | Deferred — blocked on ToS |
| Chat experience | Deferred |
| Basic web app | **MVP** — three route groups |
| Order history | **MVP** — customer portal |
| Order status page | **MVP** — order detail timeline |
| Driver/dispatcher updates status in admin view | **MVP** — dispatcher console + driver app |
| Automated texting of status | Deferred — see automated status fan-out |
| Replenish funds | Deferred — see prepaid billing |
| Automate dispatcher | **Partially MVP** — broadcast, acceptance, and fee capture automated; review remains human |
| Broadcasting to agents based on filters | **MVP (unfiltered)** — fan-out to all active drivers |
| Automated cart parsing | **MVP** — this is the core of the product |
| Highlighted item numbers / aisles / store location | **Partial** — model numbers and store are MVP; aisle/bay deferred |
| Centralizing confirmation photos | **MVP** — `attachments` + private storage |
| Phone app for company / agent | Deferred — PWA covers the MVP |
| Fee/price point modelling | **Deferred by decision** — manual fee entry |
| Substitutions | Deferred |
| Order cancellation | Deferred |
| Who places the order | **Resolved** — the driver purchases; the customer never does |
| Driver selection vs volunteering | **Resolved** — volunteer, first-accept-wins |
| Communication channels | **Resolved** — in-app + SMS; email to customers |
| QR/handoff confirmation | Deferred |
